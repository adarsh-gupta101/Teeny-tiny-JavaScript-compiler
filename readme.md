# Teeny Tiny JavaScript Compiler

Okay, so this is a very small compiler for a very small subset of JavaScript. It's not very useful, but it's a fun and interesting project to learn more about compilers.

## The Compiler

So What's a compiler?

A compiler is a program that translates code written in one language to another. In this case, we're going to write a compiler that translates JavaScript code to output the result.

## The Code
 
 ```
    x =  3 * 4;
    y = 4*5;
    print y;
    print (x + y);
 ```

## The Output

```
    20
    32
```
